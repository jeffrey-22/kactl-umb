 * Description: Online algorithm for minimal deterministic
 * finite automaton that accepts the suffixes of a string
 * \texttt{s}.
 *
 * Exactly all substrings of \texttt{s} are
 * represented by the states, each state representing one or
 * more substrings. Let \texttt{t} the longest string
 * represented by state \texttt{v}. Then \texttt{v.len ==
 * sz(t)}, all strings represented by \texttt{v} only appear in
 * \texttt{s} as a suffix of \texttt{t} and they are the
 * longest suffixes of \texttt{t}. The rest of the suffixes of
 * \texttt{t} are found by following the suffix links
 * \texttt{v.l}. \texttt{p} is the state representing
 * \texttt{s} so terminal states are the ones in the path from
 * \texttt{p} to the root through suffix links. Also suffix
 * links form the suffix tree of reversed \texttt{s}. Here you can see
 * the automaton for abcbc:
 *
 * \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
 *   \input{content/strings/SuffixAutomaton.tikz}
 * }
 *
 * \vspace{-1mm}
 * Complexity is amortized: \texttt{extend} adds 1 or 2 states
 * but can change many suffix links. Up to 2N states and 3N
 * transitions. For larger alphabets, use \texttt{T = ll}. For
 * performance consider \texttt{s.reserve(2*N)}, and replacing
 * \texttt{map} with \texttt{vector} or
 * \texttt{unordered\_map}.
 * Time: O(N \log K).
 * Status: stress-tested
